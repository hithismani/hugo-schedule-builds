### Scheduling Builds In Hugo: Publish Any Time.

The code in this repo is explained in [this guide](https://businessaddons.com/guides/automate-hugo-site-rebuilds-efficient-scheduling-guide/), aimed at helping you get started with scheduling posts on Hugo. 

By the end of the guide, you should be able to:
- Schedule posts to go live at any future date
- Schedule rebuilds when posts expire, or certain custom posts (eg: 'events') have concluded.

Adapt the code as per your own business logic!

_Video guide coming soon._
